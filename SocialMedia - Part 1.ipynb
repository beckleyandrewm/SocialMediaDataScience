    "# 1.0 Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Analysis of social-media discussions has grown to be an important tool for biomedical informatics researchers, particularly for addressing questions relevant to public perceptions of health and related matters. Studies have examination of a range of topics at the intersection of health and social media, including studies of how [Facebook might be used to commuication health information](http://www.jmir.org/2016/8/e218/), how Tweets might be used to understand how smokers perceive [e-cigarettes, hookahs and other emerging smoking products](https://www.jmir.org/2013/8/e174/), and many others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although each investigation has unique aspects, studies of social media generally share several common tasks. Data acquisition is often the first challenge: although some data may be freely available, there are often [limits](https://dev.twitter.com/rest/public/rate-limits) as to how much data can be queried easily. Researchers might look out for [opportunities for accessing larger amounts of data](https://www.wired.com/2014/02/twitter-promises-share-secrets-academia/). Some studies contract with [commercial services providing fee-based access](https://gnip.com). \n",
    "\n",
    "Once a data set is hand, the next step is often to identify key terms and phrases relating to the research question. Messages might be annotated to indicate specific categorizations of interest - indicating, for example, if a message referred to a certain aspect of a disease or symptom. Similarly, key words and phrases regularly occurring in the content might also be identified. Natural language and text processing techniques might be used to extract key words, phrases, and relationships, and machine learning tools might be used to build classifiers capable of distinguishing between types of tweets of interest. \n",
    "\n",
    "This module presents a preliminary overview of these techniques, using Python 3 and several auxiliary libraries to explore the application of these techniques to Twitter data. \n",

Although details of the tools used to access data and the format and content of the data may differ for various services, the strategies and procedures used to analyze the data will generalize to other tools."

    "[Twitter](www.twitter.com) provides limited capabilities for searching tweets through an Application Programming Interface (API) based on Representational State Transfer (REST).  [REST](https://doi.org/10.1145/337180.337228) is an approach to using web-based Hypertext-Transfer Protocol (HTTP) requests as APIs. \n",
    "\n",
    "Essentially, a REST API specifies conventions for HTTP requests that might be used to retrieve specific data items from a remote server. Unlike traditional HTTP requests, which return HTML markup to be rendered in web browsers, REST APIs return data formatted in XML or JSON, suitable for interpretation by computer programs. REST APIs from familiar websites underlie frequently-seen functionality such as embedded twitter widgets and \"like/share\" links, among others.\n",
    "\n",
    "Commercial REST applications often use \"API-Keys\" - unique identifiers used to associate requests with registered accounts. Here, we will walk through the process of registering for Twitter API keys and using a Python library to manage the details of making a Twitter API request and receiving a response.\n",

    "The first step in registering for a Twitter API key is to [signup](https://twitter.com/signup) for an account. If you don't want to post anything or to use the account in any way that might be linked to your regular email adddress, you might want to create a special-purpose account using a service such as gmail, and use this new email address for the twitter account.\n",

    "Go to  [Twitter's developer site](https://dev.twitter.com) an click on the \"apply\" link to create a developer account (look on the upper-right cornder, near the magnifying glass search icon). Follow the listed steps, indicating that you are interested in access for your own personal use. You will need to answer a few questions about the assignment and your goals. Answer these questions as appropriate - simply indicate that you are working on a class assignment and that you won't be showing anything commecially. Submit your application and wait for it to be approved. This might take a bit of time - please start early.\n",

Click on \"Create New App\" in the upper right and then fill out the form. The main thing that you need to focus on here is the application name, description, and website. The rest can be ignored.\n",
    "\n",

I have noticed that the same search run twice in succession might yield almost identical results, which is not what we want if we are looking for a large, diverse set.

Unlike sampling based on geographical constraints such as place of residence, data sampled from social media does not draw from any well-characterized population.

    "Diversity of times could help us identify changes over time. Depending on how long we set the time interval to be, we could look at how the frequency or language of the tweets change over time and this could be an indication of changing uses/viewpoints.  Additionally, diversity of times would provide a more thorough explanation than a narrowed time focused search.  You could ensure diversity of times by adjusting search parameters to extract a certain number of tweets from each month for so many years. You could set parameters on how many can come from each desired time interval, which might help reduce a time bias in the data.  Other forms of data diversity could be from different geohraphical regions. I am unsure if you have access to geographical data for the users, but if you did then you could set limits on how many tweets can come from each state, and ensure that you had enough tweets from each state. \n"
