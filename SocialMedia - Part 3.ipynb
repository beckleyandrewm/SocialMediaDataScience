    "Natural Language Processing involves a series of operations on an input text, each building off of the previous step to add additional insight and undertanding.  Thus, many NLP packages run as pipeline processors providing modular components at each stage of the process. Separating key steps into discrete packages provides needed modularity, as developers can modify and customize individual components as needed. spaCy, like other NLP tools including [GATE](https://gate.ac.uk/) and [cTAKES](https://ctaes.apache.org)  operate on such a model. Although the specific components of each pipeline vary from system to system (and from tasks to task, the key tasks are roughly similar:\n",

    "1. *Tokenizing*: splitting the text into words, punctuation, and other markers.\n",
    "2. *Part of speech tagging*: Classifying terms as nouns, verbs, adjective, adverbs, ec.\n",
    "3. *Dependency Parsing* or *Chunking*: Defining relationships between tokens (subject and object of sentence) and grouping into noun and veb phrases.\n",
    "4. *Named Entity Recognition*: Mapping words or phrases to standard vocabularies or other common, known values. This step is often key for linking free text to accepted terms for diseases, symptoms, and/or anatomic locations.\n",
    "\n",
    "Each of these steps might be accomplished through rules, machine learning models, or some combination of approaches. After these initial steps are complete, results might be used to identify relationships between items in the text, build classifiers, or otherwise conduct further analysis. We'll get into these topics later.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [spaCy documentation](https://spaCy.io/usage/spaCy-101) and [cTAKES default pipeline description](https://cwiki.apache.org/confluence/display/CTAKES/Default+Clinical+Pipeline) provide two examples of how these components might be arranged in practice.

They differ only in the use of the trailing underscore - thus `lemma` is the hash while `lemma_` is the human readable form.\n",

    "3.1.1 Using the `getRandomTweetText`, and `printTokDetails` routines above, aong with the spaCy `parser` command, examine several tweets to decide which tokens should be included or not.  List criteria for keeeping/removing tokens. Remember to use `spacy.explain()` for any unfamiliar POS or tag entries. Note that your  criteria will not be perfect, and will likely need refinining. Examine enough tweets to feel confident in your criteria. Because we are parsing tweets, please don't forget hashtags and user mentions.\n",

    "3.1.2 Write a routine  `includeToken` that will return a token to be inclued if it matches the criteria that you identified in 3.11, and false otherwise.  Assume for now that we are only interested in nouns and verbs, as they might be a good starting point to find information about vaping or smoking. For any tokens that are included,`includeToken` should return the lemmatized-version of the token, converted to all lower-case and stripped of any whitespace, using `strip()`. Zero-length tokens should not be included.\n",

    "3.1.3 Write a routine `filterTweetTokens` that will filter the parsed tokens from a single tweet, returning a list of the tokens to be included, based on your criteria from `includeToken`.

There were proper nouns used frequently in both of the tweet sets, so that is not helpful. The vaping tweets appeared to have more emoji's than the smoking tweets, but this also is not helpful in determining anything besides the idea that people who vape might be younger than those that smoke.  \n",

    "Although the examination of a few selected tweets might help us understand some of the trends in terminology and how they differ between the `smoking` and the `vaping` sets, these spot checks may not give a balanced picture of text usage across both of the corpora.  Here we will try to more systematically address the questions that you considered in Exercise 3.2.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "A most systematic way to go about this would be to identify frequently-occurring tokens in  both corpora, using methods similar to those used in our examination of frequent authors from  [Part 1](SocialMedia%20-%20Part%201.ipynb) and in `getCodeProfile()` from [Part 2](SocialMedia%20-%20.ipynb). Specifically, we will write a routine that iterates through all of the tweets in a Tweets object and does the following:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Parse the tweet\n",

    "The result will be a hash with the number of times each term occurs in the corpus. We can then sort this hash by descending values of the count to find the most frequent terms, and we can comapare results for the two sets. We'll return this information in two forms - a hash (for quick access) and a list (for sorting):"
